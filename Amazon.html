<!-- Intro -->
               <h2 style="margin-top:10%" id="automate-your-bot-design">What is Amazon Easy?</h2>
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:5%">
                  The mission of the Amazon Easy is to enable everybody in India to buy from Amazon. India is a mobile first nation where people mostly rely on prepaid data and where there is 1 hotstop per 3,900 people. Hundreds of millions of users face transaction barriers due to flaky internet, language, access, education and payment methods. Amazon Easy also aims to bridge the trust gap as the customers rely on a <b>fully-assisted shopping model</b>. </p> 
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:5%">Amazon Easy is a service that will place tablet devices loaded with the Amazon Easy app at the brick and mortar stores/points in tier 3+ towns in India. The customers walking into the store will order products through the tablet and pick them up from the store once delivered. The payment will be made in cash to the store owner thus eliminating issues associated with internet and credit cards. 
               </p>

               <h2 style="margin-top:10%" id="automate-your-bot-design">Competitor Audit</h2>
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:0%">The product discovery and product evaluation flows are largely consumer driven and tend to be the primary flows to increase conversion in. In order to know the state of art, I conducted a competitve analysis of the product discovery and product evaluation paths, features involved and UI standards of popular e-commerce sites in India. 
               </p>

<!-- User Research -->
               <h2 style="margin-top:10%" id="automate-your-bot-design">User Research: Rural India and e-commerce</h2>
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:2%"> In order to understand how rural India perceives and uses e-commerce, I went to two villages in India. I used contextual enquiries and think aloud protocols to understand the background of buyers and shopkeepers, mental models and needs. The think aloud protocols with the initial pilot prototype helped me observe familiarity with interface elements, understand customer paths with different levels of purchasing clarity. In order to test flows that weren't a part of the pilot product, paper prototypes were used.

               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:2%"> The primary user is the customer who walks into the brick and mortar store and the secondary user is the shopkeeper who operates the store alogn with guiding the customer with the Amazon Easy App.

<!-- The customer Journey -->

               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:2%"> The think aloud protocol with the pilot app unveiled the users' frustrations and needs at every point in the product discovery and evaluation process and their exposure to technology and e-commerce. The customer journey map below illustrates them.

               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:0%">The whole product discovery and evluation experience was rethought inorder to fit and empower the lives of the users. We came up with higher level product features or ideologies that would be applied to individual product components and in some cases the whole product itself.

               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:2%"> Based on themes that emerged from affinity mapping, new product features were proposed and based on mental models of users and their capabilities, new user flows were made.

<!-- Conclusion -->
               <h2 style="margin-top:10%" id="automate-your-bot-design">The Final Design</h2>
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:5%">The higher fidelity mocks are avoided due to a NDA. Throughout the 2 months, I presented the research findings and new task flows to several product teams and went through a round of critique and feedback. <br> Wireframes and high fidelity clickable wireframes were made. Based on expert review and feedback from managers, I made changes in every successive iteration. I delivered a full UX specification document with wireframes and mock-ups. No final product details or names are included here due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

<!-- What I Learned -->
               <h2 style="margin-top:10%" id="automate-your-bot-design">What I Learnt?</h2>
               <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;margin-top:-1.5%;margin-bottom:2%">Co-design is always helpful to provide increased knowledge and empathy with potential users. It helps with more confident decision making esp. while designing a new type of service or introducing a piece of technology to which users have never been exposed to.<br><br>
               Just thinking in terms of re-designing the existing product does not help while trying to fit the product into a new user's life. Often, it requires re-thinking of the how a service can fit and empower. It might involve changing of revenue models and big business decisions. <br><br>
               Culture plays an important role in trust. It is important to understand what the primary and secondary users are sensitive to and what they are willing to accept.<br><br>
               It is also important to think about the loading times and design for low internet speeds. <br><br>
               In contexts where word-of-mouth reviews are so significant, it was important to think about how build trust in the service and build trust in the products they bought.<br><br>
               I learned the User Centered Design methodology followed at Amazon, that I find useful to refer back to in my work. I learned working directly, and communicating seamlessly with developers and learned periodic work presentation for critique sessions. I was guided by an amazing manager, who taught me a great deal about the product based industry and data analysis techniques.
