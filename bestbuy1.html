Members of my group: Kaylin Broussard, Jeremy Philipp, Jason Paul. We studied the offline laptop buying experience at Best Buy using User centered Research Methodologies, synthesized the collected data, presented design directions, wireframes and evaluated a solution.</b></p><br>

                            <div class="row centered">

                                    <p>According to a study by Pew Research Center, <b style = "font-weight: 600">70% of the US adults own laptops.</b> With increasing human needs, laptops have branched into several sizes, forms and types. For e.g. 2 in 1s, chromebooks etc. Today, there are a plethora of laptops that offer the same set of features and specifications: same microprocessors, RAM capacity, graphics cards, networking and wireless functionality. And with increasing number of devices available for personal computing, <b style = "font-weight: 600">consumers today struggle to understand what PC fits their needs.</b> </p> <br>

                                    <p> We aim to solve various problems customers face in their <b style = "font-weight: 600">offline laptop purchase funnel.</b> The team chose to focus to on one popular retailer, <b style = "font-weight: 600"> Best Buy </b>, rather than particular laptop manufacturers. Interest to understand showrooming issues, personal antecedents, other retailers' AR/VR  applications to supplement in-store purchasing lead to choosing the Best-buy in-store context.</p><br>

                                    <p>The project started with <b style = "font-weight: 600">studying laptops, their evolution, similar products, purchasing points/outlets, laptop consumers and about Best Buy.</b> We studied Best Buy's consumer profiles.

                                <p>Based on those topics, we created themes that were common throughout the reviews. Additionally, commonly used words were noted along with those that were interestingly unique. All of those findings were compiled and used in the next stages of analysis.   </p>

                            <p> The main purpose of conducting a survey was to gather information about the tools and resources that consumers use while making a laptop purchase. We used e-mail, Facebook, Slack and Reddit for soliciting e-mail responses. The purpose of inviting participants using a variety of social media was to reach a range of consumers to gather a broad sample group. Takeaways were recorded and reviewed to look for broader themes and key data points.</p> <p>Responses from our longer format survey were used to obtain a clearer picture of our “average user”. Many of the insights that were gathered from the survey were reiterated in more detail during the interviews. </p>
